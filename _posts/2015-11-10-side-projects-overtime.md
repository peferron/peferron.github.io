title: Experimenting with overtime and side projects
---

*Warning: this post is completely about myself. Writing helps me clear my thoughts.*

Last year, I decided to put all my new side projects on Github. One year later I had a nice present: 1000 commits!

{% include figure.html src="github1000.png" %}

It was a cool achievement because I didn't try to game the system. Every single commit was meaningful and helped me become better at what I do.

Then I decided to drop my side projects and work overtime on my day job instead. There was a project at work that could benefit from it, and my side projects did not carry much responsibility, so it seemed a good time to try it out.

When I say *drop*, I don't mean it halfway. I didn't push a single commit in 3 months.

But what about the effect on my day job?

TL;DR not worth it. My output in the first two months clearly increased. But then I could feel burnout approaching. (I started a company a few years ago and failed; it left me with a mangled bank account but also with a keen sense of where my limits are.) I subconsciously protected myself by increasing the time spent relaxing instead of working. By month four my output had decreased back to normal. The only difference was that I would relax by going out or goofing off at home, instead of working on my side projects like before.

My happiness level also took a massive plunge. Months two and three were awful.

Lessons from this experiment:

* Side projects contribute a lot to my happiness. I started again yesterday and it feels great.
* Time spent on side projects does not contribute much towards my burnout limit.
* Heavy overtime worksâ€”for a time. After one month my mental state starts to suffer. After three months my output decreases back to normal.

Side projects contribute a lot to my happiness because they are a great way to learn. In my opinion, `d` hours of day job plus `s` hours of side projects is a much better learning strategy than `d + s` hours of day job without any side projects. No matter how great the day job is. (This might be untrue for special cases like founder or sole engineer in a tiny startup. The range of responsibilities there is so vast it's like having a myriad of side projects that happen to be related.)

Becoming better on your own will end up benefiting your day job as well. Eventually you will bring more value in `d` hours that you would have in `d + s` otherwise. This is especially true if you enjoy your day job and intend to stay for many years.

This is old news to anyone who played or watched real-time strategy games such as Starcraft. You don't want to spend 100% of your economy producing SCVs (the Terran worker in Starcraft). But, unless going for a timing push, you don't want to completely stop producing SCVs either, or you will get crushed long-term. Your best strategy is to keep a steady production of SCVs going for almost the entire duration of the game.

Your side projects are your SCVs. Keep building them.

(This is a terrible analogy.)
